Basic Writing is a beginning writing course that is designed to help students develop the writing skills they will need to succeed in college.  The approach of this course does not involve the learning of writing in terms of old-fashioned, school-house ""grammar"" and usage rules.  In this course, students will learn about the writing processes that will give them the power to express their ideas clearly and effectively.  These processes will move the writing from the discovery of a main idea through the techniques and strategies of elaborating, defining, and organizing, toward a refinement of expression that includes the finer points of syntax and standard conventions.  Since this course requires a student to proceed sequentially through its curriculum, mastering the subject matter of early components before later ones, students will be allowed to proceed through the curriculum at their own pace."
