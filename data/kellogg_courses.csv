INRE 30020,DC Generation Principles,0.58,"Students will learn how to transfer the energy produced by the wind and converted to rotational energy, into electricity. The simplest systems utilize DC generators mostly because the energy produced can be directly stored in batteries. Although DC energy has its drawbacks, this arrangement is ideal for standalone systems or systems desiring autonomy."
INRE 30030,AC Generation Principles,0.42,"Since most of the energy produced and used in the United States is AC energy, it is often advantageous to install a wind system that is capable of directly connecting to the grid power. The device that produces AC power is known as an alternator. Depending on the design of the wind system, either a generator or an alternator can be utilized to convert the energy to the desired output. This module will explore the common methods of producing alternating current."
INRE 30040,Towers,0.25,"A wind turbine will only work if it has access to moving air. Unfortunately, the air close to the ground will typically not have a lot of energy available due to nearby obstructions. To overcome this most turbines need to be elevated to harvest the clean unobstructed air currents high off the ground. Any work with wind turbines will require a working knowledge of towers and related components. In this module, the student will learn the advantages of different tower configurations, and how to work safely around them."
INRE 35010,Wind Safety,0.33,"Wind system installation presents many dangers to both the personnel involved with the system and possible bystanders nearby.

This module will outline the proper application of well-engineered wind systems for the appropriate uses."
INRE 35030,Buying a Wind System,0.50,"Once the site is chosen, all of the wind data taken, and sizing considerations are done, there is still more work to do. Individual products need to be evaluated and compared. Power ratings and specifications can be misleading and may need to be converted into like units of measurements for proper analysis. This module will give insight into the often confusing data vendors supply."
INRE 35040,Siting,0.58,"Wind data and geography are not the only factors that determine the location of a wind turbine. Equipment access to the installation site, and utilities are also key factors. At the same time consideration must be given to the location of nearby structures and other obstructions that can interrupt air flow. Local ordinances can determine equipment setbacks as well."
INRE 35050,System Installation,0.67,"In this module, students will learn the importance of proper system installation. The best components available on the market will fall short of predicted expectations if the proper installation procedures are not followed. Many installers will work with several different manufacturers and sizes of turbines and therefore students will need to employ several different methods to install the components."
INRE 35060,System Operation,0.33,Wind turbines are complex mechanical machines that require periodical maintenance and adjustment to prolong the productive life of the components. Another key factor in system performance is monitoring production trends and comparing the data to meteorological trends. This module will introduce students to the important aspects of system maintenance and monitoring.
